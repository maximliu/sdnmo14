In this paper we argue that adding SDN-capability to NaaS can greatly enhance
its management flexibilities and offer new service opportunities both for
administrators and users of on-demand network services enabled by NaaS. We
describe our approach to integrate Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) with
Software-defined networking (SDN). Specific envisioned
enhancements through SDN are explained in details and an integration
methodology and architecture are presented.

%Our discussion is based on the OpenNaaS
